Employee Performance Analysis Project - Requirements Document
Project Overview

This project aims to analyze employee performance using a synthesized dataset. The focus is on understanding how factors like salary, department, education level, and employee satisfaction impact performance. The insights will be visualized using Tableau to facilitate easy interpretation and decision-making.
Data Requirements

    Synthesized Dataset:
        Over 3000 rows of employee data.
        Fields: EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Department, JobTitle, Salary, DateHired, LastPromotionDate, PerformanceScore, Absences, EducationLevel, EmployeeSatisfaction.
        Inclusion of errors and inconsistencies for data cleaning practice.

Data Cleaning

    Identification and Correction of Errors:
        Handling missing values.
        Correcting inconsistent date formats.
        Rectifying typing errors in text fields.
        Managing outliers in numeric fields.

Data Analysis

    SQL Queries:
        Queries to extract insights, create aggregations, and perform correlation analysis.
        Examination of departmental performance.
        Exploration of salary and performance score relationships.
        Analysis of the impact of education level and employee satisfaction on performance.

Visualization Requirements

    Tableau Dashboard:
        Histogram or boxplot for performance score distribution.
        Scatter plots or correlation matrix for salary and performance.
        Bar charts for departmental comparisons.
        Customizable filters for dynamic data exploration.

Technical Requirements

    SQL Database:
        Capability to import, clean, and analyze large datasets.
    Tableau Software:
        Latest version of Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation.

Deliverables

    Cleaned Dataset:
        A CSV file of the cleaned and processed data.
    SQL Script:
        A comprehensive script for data cleaning and analysis.
    Tableau Workbook:
        An interactive dashboard visualizing key insights.

Additional Notes

    Ensure data confidentiality and ethical use of the synthesized dataset.
    Document each step in the process for replicability and future reference.
    Additional research on the legality of age related comparisons in data in a professional setting.
    Provide interpretations and potential implications of the analysis results.
